		<p> I spent most of my life not knowing what I wanted, and when I did, it was mostly something different each year. 

Ive worked as a customer advicer in a bank, a helper in a childrens house, attempted to become educated in business and then a teacher, but nothing ever grabbed me before I went to højskole where I learned that trying to make your passion into a way of living is the best way of finding your dream job.
Which is what I am striving to do from now on.
